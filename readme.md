# LeMans Scene

The awesome visuals for LeMansHack 2017!

## So, what is it?!

This project is a WebGL based Three.js scene that renders an animated landscape.
The generation of said landscape will be done using realtime data from LeMans. :O

## Keyboard Events

To help during development, for testing and for fun, there is a keyhandler for handling keyboard presses.
Some of these are for tweaking values.
Some are for helping you out. (Such as the Esc -> Toggle Play/Pause)
Others are simply for fun : )

Key | Event
--- | ---
Esc | Toggles Play/Pause
Space | Toggles Debugger
--- | Spawning Stuff
1 | Spawn in a Tree
2 | Spawn in a Cloud
3 | Spawn in a Cloud up high


Please note that these are all subject to change.
